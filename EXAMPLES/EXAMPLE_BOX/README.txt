This example simulate a 1D dam-break problem with deposition, entrainment and friction over a flat topography. 

A Python script is provided to create the input file for this example. 
Please provide four arguments:

1) Number of cells in the x-direction 

2) Volume fraction of particles

3) Flow temperature (Kelvin)

4) Logical for plot of initial solution (true or false)

Usage example of the script:

>> ./create_example.py 400 0.5 300 false

Run the solver:

>> ../../bin/IMEX_SfloW2D

A script to convert the output of the model in NetCDF4 format is provided in the UTILS folder.
First create a simbolic link of the script in this folder:

>> ln -s ../../UTILS/p2d_to_netCDF4.py .

Then, execute the python script

>> python p2d_to_netCDF4.py exampleBOX_400.bak

The new file can be plotted with Paraview.

A Python script to create an animation (mp4) of the simulation is also provided. This script plot the topography and animate the flow over it. The interval between frames in milliseconds has to be given as input.
Usage example:

>> python plot_animated.py exampleBOX_400 100
