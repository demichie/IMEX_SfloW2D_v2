This example simulate a 1D dam-break problem with deposition, entrainment and friction over a flat topography. 

A Python script is provided to create the input file for this example. 
Please provide four arguments:

1) Number of cells in the x-direction 

2) Volume fraction of particles

3) Flow temperature (Kelvin)

4) Logical for plot of initial solution (true or false)

Usage example of the script:

>> ./create_example.py 400 0.5 300 false

Run the solver:

>> ../../bin/IMEX_SfloW2D

A Python script to plot the results is provided. With this script you can choose the output and the variable to plot (h,hB,B,u,v)
Usage example:

>> python plot_phys.py exampleBOX_400_0100.p_2d B hB

A Python script to create an animation (mp4) of the simulation is also provided. This script plot the topography and animate the flow over it. The interval between frames in milliseconds has to be given as input.
Usage example:

>> python plot_animated.py exampleBOX_400 100
